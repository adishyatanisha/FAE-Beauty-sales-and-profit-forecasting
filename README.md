# FAE-Beauty-sales-and-profit-forecasting
🌟 Project Spotlight: Forecasting Sales &amp; Profits for FAE BEAUTY using Data Science 💄📈 As someone deeply interested in both consumer behavior and data-driven strategy, I chose to work on a project analyzing the sales performance of FAE Beauty — a bold and inclusive Indian beauty brand known for its message of being "Free and Equal."

🧠 Why FAE Beauty?
FAE (Free And Equal) Beauty stands out for promoting diversity and creating makeup that works across all skin tones and types. I was inspired by their philosophy and wanted to build a project that not only reflects real-world retail challenges but also helps drive meaningful business insights for ethical, growing brands like theirs.

🎯 Project Objective
To analyze 2 years of synthetic but realistic sales data for FAE BEAUTY products and build a model to:
🔍 Understand historical trends in revenue, profit, and product popularity
📈 Forecast future sales and profits across multiple product categories
💡 Identify actionable business insights that can inform inventory and marketing decisions

📊 About the Dataset
I created a dataset simulating:
18+ beauty & skincare products (e.g., Glow Serum, Lip Tint, Compact Powder, etc.)
Daily transactions including selling price, cost, discount, revenue & profit
Categories: Makeup & Skincare
Date range: Jan 2023 – Dec 2024 (2 full years)
This helped replicate a realistic sales environment for a D2C beauty brand.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Methods
Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Tasks: Data cleaning, profit margin analysis, EDA, time series preparation
Next Steps: Adding ARIMA/Prophet models for forecasting + Streamlit dashboard
This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also pushed me to think like a business analyst — understanding how data can impact decisions in branding, inventory, and pricing.
